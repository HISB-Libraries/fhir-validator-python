## Goal

FHIR Validation Service API built in Python using FastAPI, fronting the HL7
FHIR Validator CLI (`validator_cli.jar`).

## Architecture

```

     Caches terminology   -> $HOME/.fhir (default tx.fhir.org cache)
     Resolves terminology -> tx.fhir.org (unless -tx overridden)
```

Key point: the validator jar's `server` subcommand starts a **long-lived
process that itself serves HTTP** (`/validateResource`, `/loadIG`, etc). The
FastAPI app never shells out per-request — it starts this subprocess once at
app startup (`app/main.py` lifespan) and proxies each `$validate` call to it
over HTTP via `httpx.AsyncClient`. New IGs referenced by a request are loaded
into the *already-running* engine via `POST /loadIG` rather than by
restarting the process, which is what makes IG loading dynamic without
paying the (multi-second-to-minutes) engine construction cost again.

`validator_cli.jar` during development):

## Request contract (`POST /fhir/$validate`)

Body is a FHIR `Parameters` resource, as **either JSON or XML** — the
envelope format is detected from the request's `Content-Type` header
(anything containing `xml` is parsed as FHIR XML via `app/fhir_xml.py`;
everything else is parsed as JSON via `app/fhir_parameters.py`). Both
parsers produce the same internal `ValidateRequest` shape:

- `ig` (0..*): IG package id/canonical, e.g. `"hl7.fhir.us.core#5.0.1"`
- `profile` (0..*): profile canonical URL to validate against
- `format` (0..1): media type of the resource being validated —
  `application/json`, `application/fhir+json`, `application/xml`, or
  `application/fhir+xml`. Ignored/irrelevant if the resource is embedded
  inline (see below), since an inline resource's representation always
  matches its envelope (JSON body -> JSON resource, XML body -> XML
  resource).
- `resource` (1..1, required): the resource to validate, provided as **one**
  of:
  - `parameter.resource` — an inline FHIR resource (JSON object or XML
    element, matching the envelope)
  - `parameter.valueString` — raw resource text, encoded per `format`
  - `parameter.valueBase64Binary` — raw resource bytes, encoded per `format`

Response representation is chosen via the request's `Accept` header
(`resolve_accept_format` in `app/fhir_parameters.py`); if absent/unrecognized
it defaults to the request envelope's own format (JSON in, JSON out; XML in,
XML out). This applies both to the upstream `OperationOutcome` and to
synthesized error outcomes we build ourselves (`app/main.py::_outcome_response`,
which uses `app/fhir_xml.py::operation_outcome_to_xml` for the XML case).

Note `app/fhir_xml.py` is a narrow, `$validate`-specific XML parser/serializer
(just `ig`/`profile`/`format`/`resource` extraction and a fixed-shape
OperationOutcome writer) — not a general FHIR XML<->JSON converter.

## `POST /fhir/$convert`

Converts a FHIR resource between its JSON and XML representations. Unlike
`$validate`, the body is the **raw resource itself** (no `Parameters`
wrapper) -- input format is detected from `Content-Type` the same way as
`$validate` (anything containing `xml` -> XML, else JSON).

Default behavior (no `Accept` header) is to **flip** the format -- JSON in
gives XML out and vice versa. This is a deliberate divergence from the
underlying validator engine's own `/convert`, which defaults to JSON output
regardless of input when `Accept` is omitted (verified against the real
jar); `app/main.py::convert` always computes and sends an explicit `Accept`
to the engine so the flip actually happens. An explicit `Accept:
application/fhir+json`/`application/fhir+xml` header overrides the flip
(e.g. to request a JSON->JSON round-trip/pretty-print), resolved the same
way as `$validate`'s response format (`resolve_accept_format`).

The upstream response (including its own conversion-error `OperationOutcome`
on bad input, HTTP 500) is passed through as-is; we only synthesize our own
error outcome for an empty request body or an unreachable/down engine.

## `GET /fhir/$packages`

Returns a plain JSON array (not a FHIR resource) describing the packages
listed in the `PACKAGES` env var (see table below), in the order given:

```json
[
  {"name": "hl7.fhir.us.core", "version": "5.0.1", "canonicalUrl": "hl7.fhir.us.core#5.0.1"}
]
```

Pure config reflection (`app/main.py::_package_summary`, splitting each
`<id>#<version>` string on the first `#`) — it doesn't touch the
`ValidatorEngine` at all, so it responds even if the engine isn't running.
It's the same list `ValidatorEngine.load_configured_packages()` (below)
ensures are fetched/cached/loaded at startup, so it should generally match
`GET /healthz`'s `loaded_igs` field — but the two are computed
independently, so a package that fails to load (see best-effort loading
below) would still show up here without actually being loaded.

## Configuring `PACKAGES` and `DEFAULT_IG` via `.env`

`PACKAGES`, `DEFAULT_IG`, and `CI_BUILD_REPOS` are read from `.env` (see
`.env.example` for a template) specifically so they can be **edited without
rebuilding the image** — for Docker deployments pass the file with `docker
run --env-file .env ...` (or mount it at `/app/.env`) rather than baking it
in. The Python-level defaults in `app/config.py` only serve as a fallback if
no `.env`/env var is provided. Verified: running the *same* built image with
vs. without `--env-file` produced different `loaded_igs` in `/healthz` —
confirming the values genuinely come from the runtime environment, not
something frozen into the image at build time.

At startup, `ValidatorEngine.load_configured_packages()` ensures every
package in `PACKAGES` plus `DEFAULT_IG` ends up loaded. Each one is tried
against, in order, a **3-tier fallback chain** (`ValidatorEngine._load_configured_package`),
stopping at the first tier that succeeds:

1. **The FHIR package registry**, via the same `POST /loadIG` used
   everywhere else (which itself resolves cache-first/network-fallback —
   inherent validator behavior, not something we write). This is tried
   for *every* package, including ones also present in `packages/` — the
   registry always gets first refusal.
2. **A direct download from HL7's CI build server**
   (`https://build.fhir.org/ig/<Org-or-User>/<Repo-Name>/package.tgz`, see
   `app/ci_build.py`) — only attempted if tier 1 failed *and* the version
   string looks like a draft/ci-build/screenshot build (`is_ci_build_version`
   — deliberately excludes "ballot": ballot versions are routinely
   published, see below) *and* the package has a matching entry in
   `CI_BUILD_REPOS` (`<packageId>#<version>=<Org-or-User>/<Repo-Name>`).
   We don't try to derive the GitHub org/repo from the package id — it's
   not mechanically derivable (e.g. `hl7.fhir.us.mdi` builds from
   `HL7/fhir-mdi-ig`, not `HL7/fhir-us-mdi` or `HL7/mdi` — read off the
   `url` field of that package's own `package.json`, or the `repo` field
   of the matching entry in `https://build.fhir.org/ig/qas.json`, to find
   it for a new package). A successful download is extracted straight into
   `$HOME/.fhir/packages/<packageId>#<version>`, then `/loadIG` is retried.
3. **The repo's local `packages/` folder** (see "Package cache preloading"
   below) — the true last resort, only reached if both network tiers
   failed (e.g. the package is genuinely unpublished *and* either has no
   `CI_BUILD_REPOS` entry or build.fhir.org is unreachable). The matching
   folder is copied into `$HOME/.fhir/packages` and `/loadIG` is retried
   one final time.

If every tier fails, the package is logged and skipped — loading is
best-effort, same as `load_all_cached_packages()` below; it never aborts
startup.

Loading `DEFAULT_IG` (or any package, at any tier) also recursively resolves
*its own* declared dependencies the same cache-first/network-fallback way,
per the FHIR Package Cache spec's recursive resolution rules — we don't
write any dependency-walking code ourselves for that part; it's inherent
validator behavior.

Note this is a deliberate change from just fetching everything through
`/loadIG` and letting a preload step race it: earlier versions of this
service copied every `packages/` entry into the cache *before* the engine
started, which made local files an unconditional cache hit — effectively
*first* priority for anything present there, not last. That's no longer how
it works: `packages/` is now only consulted per-package, and only after
both network tiers have already been tried and failed for that specific
package.

Verified against the real jar/registry: `packages/` contains exactly two
genuinely unpublished packages (`hl7.fhir.us.vdor#0.1.1-cibuild` and
`hl7.fhir.us.mdi#3.0.0-draft` -- confirmed absent from packages.fhir.org,
which only lists `hl7.fhir.us.mdi` up to `2.0.0-snapshot2`); the other 5
entries in the default `PACKAGES` list (`hl7.fhir.us.core#5.0.1`,
`hl7.fhir.us.mdi#2.0.0`, `hl7.fhir.us.bser#2.0.0-ballot`,
`hl7.fhir.us.vr-common-library#2.0.0`, `hl7.fhir.us.vrdr#3.0.0`) are all
genuinely published and are fetched over the network every time from a
fresh cache (tier 1, first try). The two unpublished ones both have a
`CI_BUILD_REPOS` entry in `.env.example` pointing at their real
build.fhir.org repo (`HL7/fhir-vdor`, `HL7/fhir-mdi-ig` — read off their
`package.json`'s own `url` field), so in an environment with internet
access they're expected to resolve at tier 2 rather than tier 3; `packages/`
only takes over if build.fhir.org itself is unreachable (e.g. an air-gapped
deployment). Don't assume "published" for any new package added to
`PACKAGES` without checking packages.fhir.org first (see mdi#3.0.0-draft
above for why that assumption already broke once).

## Development commands

```bash
# one-time setup (editable install incl. dev deps)
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"

# run the full test suite (all validator interactions are mocked — no
# Java/jar required)
.venv/bin/pytest -q

# run a single test file / test
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_fhir_parameters.py -q
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_validate_endpoint.py::test_validate_happy_path_returns_upstream_operation_outcome -q

# lint + format (must both be clean before committing)
.venv/bin/ruff check .
.venv/bin/ruff format .

# run the API locally against a real validator_cli.jar
curl -sL -o /tmp/validator_cli.jar \
  https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/releases/latest/download/validator_cli.jar
VALIDATOR_JAR_PATH=/tmp/validator_cli.jar .venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

There is no separate typecheck/codegen step. `ruff check` + `pytest` is the
whole gate; run both before considering a change done.

> **Common pitfall:** running `uvicorn app.main:app` directly on the host
> (i.e. not via the Dockerfile) with no `VALIDATOR_JAR_PATH` set will fail
> with `Unable to access jarfile /opt/validator/validator_cli.jar` — that
> default path only exists inside the built Docker image. Always set
> `VALIDATOR_JAR_PATH` to a real downloaded jar (or `AUTO_START_VALIDATOR=false`)
> for local/host runs.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t fhir-validator-service .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v fhir-cache:/root/.fhir fhir-validator-service
```

The Dockerfile downloads the **latest** `validator_cli.jar` from GitHub at
build time (HL7 does not guarantee old versions keep working — see the
"Limitations of Use" section of the confluence docs — pin a release tag in
the Dockerfile if you need reproducible builds). Base image is
`python:3.12-slim` (Debian trixie), which requires
`openjdk-21-jre-headless` — `openjdk-17-jre-headless` is **not installable**
on trixie, don't revert to it.

The `/root/.fhir` volume is what makes the package/terminology cache survive
container restarts — always mount it in any real deployment, or every
restart re-downloads every IG and re-warms the terminology cache from
scratch (first boot took ~10s locally just for the base R4 package; adding
IGs adds more).

## Package cache preloading (`app/package_cache.py`)

Per the [FHIR Package Cache spec](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Package+Cache),
a package is "installed" purely by the existence of a
`<packageId>#<version>/package/...` folder under the cache root
(`$HOME/.fhir/packages` — no separate manifest/registration step). That
means preloading a package is just: put its already-extracted folder there
before it's needed, so it never triggers a network fetch.

`packages/` (default: `Settings.packages_dir`, relative to cwd) holds
already-extracted `<packageId>#<version>/package/...` folders for **local
IGs** — packages not published on the FHIR package registry (e.g.
draft/ci-build versions) and not (yet, or ever) mirrored by HL7's CI build
server either. Repo layout expected:

```
packages/
  hl7.fhir.us.vdor#0.1.1-cibuild/
    package/
      package.json
      StructureDefinition-....json
      ...
  hl7.fhir.uv.ips#2.0.0/
    package/
      ...
```

This is exactly the same folder shape as `$HOME/.fhir/packages` itself — you
can drop in a package by copying it straight from an existing cache, or by
extracting a `package.tgz` (`tar xzf package.tgz` into a dir named
`<id>#<version>`, with the `.tgz`'s `package/` folder as-is).

`app/package_cache.py` exposes two copy functions, both **skipping any
package that's already cached** (never overwrite/refresh an existing
entry — this is a one-time seed, not a sync):

- `preload_package(name, source_dir, cache_dir)` — copies a single named
  package. Used in two places: 1) `ValidatorEngine.start()`, for each
  `STARTUP_IGS` entry, *before* the validator subprocess is spawned — those
  are passed straight to the jar as `-ig` CLI args (see `_build_command`),
  which the jar resolves itself the instant it starts, with no chance for
  us to intervene afterwards, so any local-only one among them must already
  be on disk. 2) `ValidatorEngine._load_configured_package()`, as the
  **last-resort tier** of the `PACKAGES`/`DEFAULT_IG` fallback chain (see
  "Configuring PACKAGES and DEFAULT_IG via .env" above) — only reached
  after both the FHIR package registry and the build.fhir.org direct
  download have already been tried and failed for that specific package.
- `preload_packages(source_dir, cache_dir)` — the bulk (whole-directory)
  variant, kept for callers that genuinely want everything in a folder
  seeded at once; nothing in `ValidatorEngine` calls this anymore (see
  below for why), but it's still exercised directly by
  `tests/test_package_cache.py`.

Note the deliberate change from earlier versions of this service: previously
`ValidatorEngine.start()` called `preload_packages()` unconditionally on
**every** `packages/` entry before the engine even launched, which made
local files an unconditional cache hit for anything present there —
effectively *first* priority, not last. That's no longer how `PACKAGES`/
`DEFAULT_IG` work (see above); `packages/` is now consulted per-package, on
demand, only after both network tiers have already failed for that specific
package. `STARTUP_IGS` is the one remaining place that still preloads
proactively, and only for the specific IGs it actually references — never
the rest of `packages/`.

The Dockerfile does `COPY packages ./packages` (before `pip install`), so
these are baked into the image regardless — a fresh container still never
needs an actual `packages/`-repo checkout on the host to have the fallback
tier available, it's just consulted lazily now rather than eagerly.

## Loading cached packages into the engine at startup

Preloading (above) only puts packages on *disk*; it doesn't load them into
the *running engine's* memory -- that still happened lazily, only when a
request's `ig` parameter referenced one (via `ensure_igs_loaded()` ->

`POST /loadIG`).

`ValidatorEngine.load_all_cached_packages()` closes that gap: after the
engine reports ready, it scans the **entire** actual FHIR package cache
(`~/.fhir/packages` -- not just `packages_dir`, everything found there,
including whatever was already cached from prior runs/unrelated activity)
and `POST /loadIG`s every package not already loaded. Controlled by
`LOAD_CACHED_PACKAGES_ON_STARTUP` (default `true`).

This is deliberately **best-effort, not fail-fast**: `~/.fhir/packages` is a
shared, long-lived directory that can accumulate packages from unrelated
prior activity -- multiple FHIR versions, multiple versions of the same IG,
etc. (verified on a real dev machine: a cache with both `hl7.fhir.r4.core`
and `hl7.fhir.r5.core`, plus several versions each of `hl7.terminology.r4`
and `hl7.fhir.us.core`). A failure loading any one package is logged and
skipped; it does not raise, abort startup, or block the others. Verified
against the real jar with a 36-package "dirty" cache like this -- all 37
(36 + 1 newly preloaded) loaded successfully in ~49s with zero failures,
but the code does not assume that will always be true.

**Test hygiene note:** `tests/test_validator_engine.py`'s `_engine_with_command()`
helper defaults `load_cached_packages_on_startup=False`, `packages`/`default_ig`
to empty strings, and `packages_dir` to a nonexistent path, specifically so
subprocess-lifecycle tests never touch this machine's real `~/.fhir/packages`
or the repo's own `packages/` folder, or make an unexpected `/loadIG` call
using the real `PACKAGES` default. If you add a new test that calls
`engine.start()` directly (bypassing this helper), carry that same isolation
forward -- don't let a test's default settings resolve to real paths.

The public FastAPI port is set via the ASGI server invocation (`uvicorn
app.main:app --port ...`), not an env var.

## Known limitations (intentional, not bugs)

- `ig`/`profile` values only accept `valueString`/`valueUri`/`valueCanonical`/
  `valueCode`/`valueUrl` — not FHIR datatypes requiring deeper parsing.
- `resolve_accept_format` only matches exact media-type aliases from the
  `Accept` header (after stripping `;q=...`); it does not implement full
  HTTP content negotiation (multiple weighted candidates, wildcards beyond
  `*/*`).
- The `ValidatorEngine` runs a single validation engine per process (one
  FHIR version, one set of loaded IGs, shared across all requests). There is
  no per-request isolation; concurrent requests share loaded IGs, which is
  the entire point of the persistent-engine design (see Architecture above)
  but means you can't validate against conflicting IG *versions*
  simultaneously without loading both into the same engine.

## Testing notes

- `tests/conftest.py` provides a `FakeValidatorEngine` swapped onto
  `app.state.validator_engine` after FastAPI's lifespan startup runs (with
  `AUTO_START_VALIDATOR=false`, so no real subprocess is spawned in tests).
- `tests/test_validator_engine.py` covers `ValidatorEngine`'s subprocess
  lifecycle (readiness detection, fail-fast on early process exit, timeout)
  using trivial `sh`/`sleep` commands — no Java or the real jar needed for
  these either, just generic subprocess plumbing.
- `tests/test_package_cache.py` covers `preload_packages()` against `tmp_path`
  fixtures — also no Java/jar needed.
- `ValidatorEngine.start()` fails fast (not after waiting out
  `VALIDATOR_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) if the subprocess exits before
  reporting readiness, and includes the process's own captured output (e.g.
  the "Unable to access jarfile" message above) in the raised
  `ValidatorEngineError`. If you touch the startup-wait logic in
  `app/validator_engine.py`, keep this property — it used to silently hang
  for the full timeout on any startup failure before this was fixed.
- If you need to test against the *real* jar (e.g. verifying a new HTTP
  contract assumption), download it fresh — don't commit it — and point
  `VALIDATOR_JAR_PATH` at it; `ValidatorEngine.start()`/`.stop()` manage the
  subprocess lifecycle directly and were manually verified this way during
  development (real engine start -> `/loadIG` -> `/validateResource` ->
  clean shutdown, and the same flow through the built Docker image).
